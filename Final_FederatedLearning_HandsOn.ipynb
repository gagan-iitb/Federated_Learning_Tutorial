        "# Federated Learning on CIFAR-10 Using ResNet-18.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a simple implementation of Federated Learning using the ResNet18 model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The process includes the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Dataset Preparation: CIFAR-10 dataset is split into subsets for multiple clients, each with 500 samples.\n",
        "2.   Client-Side Training: Each client trains a model locally using a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset. Only the final classification layer of ResNet18 is trained, while the pre-trained weights of the rest of the layers are frozen.\n",
        "3. Model Aggregation: After each client completes training, their model weights are aggregated using Federated Averaging, which averages the weights of each model.\n",
        "4. Evaluation: The aggregated model is evaluated on a small test subset, and the accuracy of each individual client model is also assessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach demonstrates the core principles of Federated Learning, where models are trained locally on different clients and then combined to create a global model."
